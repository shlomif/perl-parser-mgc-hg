=head1 DESCRIPTION

This base class provides a low-level framework for building recursive-descent
parsers that consume a given input string from left to right, returning a
parse structure. It takes its name from the C<m//gc> regexps used to implement
the token parsing behaviour.

It provides a number of token-parsing methods, which each extract a
grammatical token from the string. It also provides wrapping methods that can
be used to build up a possibly-recursive grammar structure, by applying a
structure around other parts of parsing code. Each method, both token and
structural, atomically either consumes a prefix of the string and returns its
result, or fails and consumes nothing. This makes it simple to implement
grammars that require backtracking.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=cut

=head2 $parser = Parser::MGC->new( %args )

Returns a new instance of a C<Parser::MGC> object. This must be called on a
subclass that provides method of the name provided as C<toplevel>, by default
called C<parse>.

Takes the following named arguments

=over 8

=item toplevel => STRING

Name of the toplevel method to use to start the parse from. If not supplied,
will try to use a method called C<parse>.

=item patterns => HASH

Keys in this hash should map to quoted regexp (C<qr//>) references, to
override the default patterns used to match tokens. See C<PATTERNS> below

=item accept_0o_oct => BOOL

If true, the C<token_int> method will also accept integers with a C<0o> prefix
as octal.

=back

=cut

=head1 PATTERNS

The following pattern names are recognised. They may be passed to the
constructor in the C<patterns> hash, or provided as a class method under the
name C<pattern_I<name>>.

=over 4

=item * ws

Pattern used to skip whitespace between tokens. Defaults to C</[\s\n\t]+/>

=item * comment

Pattern used to skip comments between tokens. Undefined by default.

=item * int

Pattern used to parse an integer by C<token_int>. Defaults to
C</-?(?:0x[[:xdigit:]]+|[[:digit:]]+)/>. If C<accept_0o_oct> is given, then
this will be expanded to match C</0o[0-7]+/> as well.

=item * float

Pattern used to parse a floating-point number by C<token_float>. Defaults to
C</-?(?:\d*\.\d+|\d+\.)(?:e-?\d+)?|-?\d+e-?\d+/i>.

=item * ident

Pattern used to parse an identifier by C<token_ident>. Defaults to
C</[[:alpha:]_]\w*/>

=item * string_delim

Pattern used to delimit a string by C<token_string>. Defaults to C</["']/>.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 $result = $parser->from_string( $str )

Parse the given literal string and return the result from the toplevel method.

=cut

sub from_string
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $str ) = @_;

   $self->{str} = $str;

   pos $self->{str} = 0;

   my $toplevel = $self->{toplevel};
   my $result = $self->$toplevel;

   $self->at_eos or
      $self->fail( "Expected end of input" );

   return $result;
}

=head2 $result = $parser->from_file( $file )

Parse the given file, which may be a pathname in a string, or an opened IO
handle, and return the result from the toplevel method.

=cut

sub from_file
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $filename ) = @_;

   $self->{filename} = $filename;

   $self->from_string( scalar(slurp $filename) );
}

=head2 $result = $parser->from_reader( \&reader )

Parse the input which is read by the C<reader> function. This function will be
called in scalar context to generate portions of string to parse, being passed
the C<$parser> object. The function should return C<undef> when it has no more
string to return.

 $reader->( $parser )

Note that because it is not generally possible to detect exactly when more
input may be required due to failed regexp parsing, the reader function is
only invoked during searching for skippable whitespace. This makes it suitable
for reading lines of a file in the common case where lines are considered as
skippable whitespace, or for reading lines of input interractively from a
user. It cannot be used in all cases (for example, reading fixed-size buffers
from a file) because two successive invocations may split a single token
across the buffer boundaries, and cause parse failures.

=cut

sub from_reader
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $reader ) = @_;

   local $self->{reader} = $reader;

   $self->{str} = "";
   pos $self->{str} = 0;

   my $result = $self->parse;

   $self->at_eos or
      $self->fail( "Expected end of input" );

   return $result;
}

=head2 $pos = $parser->pos

Returns the current parse position, as a character offset from the beginning
of the file or string.

=cut

sub pos
{
   my $self = shift;
   return pos $self->{str};
}

=head2 ( $lineno, $col, $text ) = $parser->where

Returns the current parse position, as a line and column number, and
the entire current line of text. The first line is numbered 1, and the first
column is numbered 0.

=cut

sub where
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $pos ) = @_;

   defined $pos or $pos = pos $self->{str};

   my $str = $self->{str};

   my $sol = $pos;
   $sol-- if $sol > 0 and substr( $str, $sol, 1 ) =~ m/^[\r\n]$/;
   $sol-- while $sol > 0 and substr( $str, $sol-1, 1 ) !~ m/^[\r\n]$/;

   my $eol = $pos;
   $eol++ while $eol < length($str) and substr( $str, $eol, 1 ) !~ m/^[\r\n]$/;

   my $line = substr( $str, $sol, $eol - $sol );

   my $col = $pos - $sol;
   my $lineno = ( () = substr( $str, 0, $pos ) =~ m/\n/g ) + 1;

   return ( $lineno, $col, $line );
}

=head2 $parser->fail( $message )

=head2 $parser->fail_from( $pos, $message )

Aborts the current parse attempt with the given message string. The failure
message will include the line and column position, and the line of input that
failed at the current parse position, or a position earlier obtained using the
C<pos> method.

=cut

sub fail
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $message ) = @_;
   $self->fail_from( $self->pos, $message );
}

sub fail_from
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $pos, $message ) = @_;
   die Parser::MGC::Failure->new( $message, $self, $pos );
}

=head2 $eos = $parser->at_eos

Returns true if the input string is at the end of the string.

=cut

sub at_eos
{
   my $self = shift;

   # Save pos() before skipping ws so we don't break the substring_before method
   my $pos = pos $self->{str};

   $self->skip_ws;

   my $at_eos;
   if( pos( $self->{str} ) >= length $self->{str} ) {
      $at_eos = 1;
   }
   elsif( defined $self->{endofscope} ) {
      $at_eos = $self->{str} =~ m/\G$self->{endofscope}/;
   }
   else {
      $at_eos = 0;
   }

   pos( $self->{str} ) = $pos;

   return $at_eos;
}

=head2 $level = $parser->scope_level

Returns the number of nested C<scope_of> calls that have been made.

=cut

sub scope_level
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{scope_level};
}

=head1 STRUCTURE-FORMING METHODS

The following methods may be used to build a grammatical structure out of the
defined basic token-parsing methods. Each takes at least one code reference,
which will be passed the actual C<$parser> object as its first argument.

=cut

=head2 $ret = $parser->maybe( $code )

Attempts to execute the given C<$code> reference in scalar context, and
returns what it returned. If the code fails to parse by calling the C<fail>
method then none of the input string will be consumed; the current parsing
position will be restored. C<undef> will be returned in this case.

This may be considered to be similar to the C<?> regexp qualifier.

 sub parse_declaration
 {
    my $self = shift;

    [ $self->parse_type,
      $self->token_ident,
      $self->maybe( sub {
         $self->expect( "=" );
         $self->parse_expression
      } ),
    ];
 }

=cut

sub maybe
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $code ) = @_;

   my $pos = pos $self->{str};

   my $committed = 0;
   local $self->{committer} = sub { $committed++ };

   my $ret;
   eval { $ret = $code->( $self ); 1 } and return $ret;
   my $e = $@;

   pos($self->{str}) = $pos;

   die $e if $committed or not eval { $e->isa( "Parser::MGC::Failure" ) };
   return undef;
}

=head2 $ret = $parser->scope_of( $start, $code, $stop )

Expects to find the C<$start> pattern, then attempts to execute the given
C<$code> reference, then expects to find the C<$stop> pattern. Returns
whatever the code reference returned.

While the code is being executed, the C<$stop> pattern will be used by the
token parsing methods as an end-of-scope marker; causing them to raise a
failure if called at the end of a scope.

 sub parse_block
 {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->scope_of( "{", sub { $self->parse_statements }, "}" );
 }

If the C<$start> pattern is undefined, it is presumed the caller has already
checked for this. This is useful when the stop pattern needs to be calculated
based on the start pattern.

 sub parse_bracketed
 {
    my $self = shift;

    my $delim = $self->expect( qr/[\(\[\<\{]/ );
    $delim =~ tr/([<{/)]>}/;

    $self->enter_scope( undef, sub { $self->parse_body }, $delim );
 }

=cut

sub scope_of
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $start, $code, $stop ) = @_;

   ref $stop or $stop = qr/\Q$stop/;

   $self->expect( $start ) if defined $start;

   local $self->{endofscope} = $stop;
   local $self->{scope_level} = $self->{scope_level} + 1;

   my $ret = $code->( $self );

   $self->expect( $stop );

   return $ret;
}

=head2 $ret = $parser->list_of( $sep, $code )

Expects to find a list of instances of something parsed by C<$code>,
separated by the C<$sep> pattern. Returns an ARRAY ref containing a list of
the return values from the C<$code>.

This method does not consider it an error if the returned list is empty; that
is, that the scope ended before any item instances were parsed from it.

 sub parse_numbers
 {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->list_of( ",", sub { $self->token_int } );
 }

=cut

sub list_of
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $sep, $code ) = @_;

   ref $sep or $sep = qr/\Q$sep/ if defined $sep;

   my $committed;
   local $self->{committer} = sub { $committed++ };

   my @ret;

   while( !$self->at_eos ) {
      $committed = 0;
      my $pos = pos $self->{str};

      eval { push @ret, $code->( $self ); 1 } and next;
      my $e = $@;

      pos($self->{str}) = $pos;
      die $e if $committed or not eval { $e->isa( "Parser::MGC::Failure" ) };
      last;
   }
   continue {
      if( defined $sep ) {
         $self->skip_ws;
         $self->{str} =~ m/\G$sep/gc or last;
      }
   }

   return \@ret;
}

=head2 $ret = $parser->sequence_of( $code )

A shortcut for calling C<list_of> with an empty string as separator; expects
to find at least one instance of something parsed by C<$code>, separated only
by skipped whitespace.

This may be considered to be similar to the C<+> or C<*> regexp qualifiers.

 sub parse_statements
 {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->sequence_of( sub { $self->parse_statement } );
 }

=cut

sub sequence_of
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $code ) = @_;

   $self->list_of( undef, $code );
}

=head2 $ret = $parser->any_of( @codes )

Expects that one of the given code references can parse something from the
input, returning what it returned. Each code reference may indicate a failure
to parse by calling the C<fail> method.

This may be considered to be similar to the C<|> regexp operator for forming
alternations of possible parse trees.

 sub parse_statement
 {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->any_of(
       sub { $self->parse_declaration; $self->expect(";") },
       sub { $self->parse_expression; $self->expect(";") },
       sub { $self->parse_block },
    );
 }

Note: This method used to be called C<one_of>, but was renamed for clarity.
Currently this method is provided also as an alias by the old name. Code
using the old name should be rewritten to C<any_of> instead, as this 
backward-compatibility alias may be removed in a later version.

=cut

sub any_of
{
   my $self = shift;

   while( @_ ) {
      my $pos = pos $self->{str};

      my $committed = 0;
      local $self->{committer} = sub { $committed++ };

      my $ret;
      eval { $ret = shift->( $self ); 1 } and return $ret;
      my $e = $@;

      pos( $self->{str} ) = $pos;

      die $e if $committed or not eval { $e->isa( "Parser::MGC::Failure" ) };
   }

   $self->fail( "Found nothing parseable" );
}

*one_of = \&any_of;

=head2 $parser->commit

Calling this method will cancel the backtracking behaviour of the innermost
C<maybe>, C<list_of>, C<sequence_of>, or C<any_of> structure forming method.
That is, if later code then calls C<fail>, the exception will be propagated
out of C<maybe>, and no further code blocks will be attempted by C<any_of>.

Typically this will be called once the grammatical structure of an
alternation has been determined, ensuring that any further failures are raised
as real exceptions, rather than by attempting other alternatives.

 sub parse_statement
 {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->any_of(
       ...
       sub {
          $self->scope_of( "{",
             sub { $self->commit; $self->parse_statements; },
          "}" ),
       },
    );
 }

=cut

sub commit
{
   my $self = shift;
   if( $self->{committer} ) {
      $self->{committer}->();
   }
   else {
      croak "Cannot commit except within a backtrack-able structure";
   }
}

=head1 TOKEN PARSING METHODS

The following methods attempt to consume some part of the input string, to be
used as part of the parsing process.

=cut

sub skip_ws
{
   my $self = shift;

   my $ws = $self->{patterns}{ws};
   my $c  = $self->{patterns}{comment};

   {
      1 while $self->{str} =~ m/\G$ws/gc or
              ( $c and $self->{str} =~ m/\G$c/gc );

      return if pos( $self->{str} ) < length $self->{str};

      return unless $self->{reader};

      my $more = $self->{reader}->( $self );
      if( defined $more ) {
         my $pos = pos( $self->{str} );
         $self->{str} .= $more;
         pos( $self->{str} ) = $pos;

         redo;
      }

      undef $self->{reader};
      return;
   }
}

=head2 $str = $parser->expect( $literal )

=head2 $str = $parser->expect( qr/pattern/ )

=head2 @groups = $parser->expect( qr/pattern/ )

Expects to find a literal string or regexp pattern match, and consumes it.
In scalar context, this method returns the string that was captured. In list
context it returns the matching substring and the contents of any subgroups
contained in the pattern.

This method will raise a parse error (by calling C<fail>) if the regexp fails
to match. Note that if the pattern could match an empty string (such as for
example C<qr/\d*/>), the pattern will always match, even if it has to match an
empty string. This method will not consider a failure if the regexp matches
with zero-width.

=head2 $str = $parser->maybe_expect( ... )

=head2 @groups = $parser->maybe_expect( ... )

A convenient shortcut equivalent to calling C<expect> within C<maybe>, but
implemented more efficiently, avoiding the exception-handling set up by
C<maybe>. Returns C<undef> or an empty list if the match fails.

=cut

sub maybe_expect
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $expect ) = @_;

   ref $expect or $expect = qr/\Q$expect/;

   $self->skip_ws;
   $self->{str} =~ m/\G$expect/gc or return;

   return substr( $self->{str}, $-[0], $+[0]-$-[0] ) if !wantarray;
   return map { substr( $self->{str}, $-[$_], $+[$_]-$-[$_] ) } 0 .. $#+;
}

sub expect
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $expect ) = @_;

   ref $expect or $expect = qr/\Q$expect/;

   if( wantarray ) {
      my @ret = $self->maybe_expect( $expect ) or
         $self->fail( "Expected $expect" );
      return @ret;
   }
   else {
      defined( my $ret = $self->maybe_expect( $expect ) ) or
         $self->fail( "Expected $expect" );
      return $ret;
   }
}

=head2 $str = $parser->substring_before( $literal )

=head2 $str = $parser->substring_before( qr/pattern/ )

Expects to possibly find a literal string or regexp pattern match. If it finds
such, consume all the input text before but excluding this match, and return
it. If it fails to find a match before the end of the current scope, consumes
all the input text until the end of scope and return it.

This method does not consume the part of input that matches, only the text
before it. It is not considered a failure if the substring before this match
is empty. If a non-empty match is required, use the C<fail> method:

 sub token_nonempty_part
 {
    my $self = shift;

    my $str = $parser->substring_before( "," );
    length $str or $self->fail( "Expected a string fragment before ," );

    return $str;
 }

Note that unlike most of the other token parsing methods, this method does not
consume either leading or trailing whitespace around the substring. It is
expected that this method would be used as part a parser to read quoted
strings, or similar cases where whitespace should be preserved.

=cut

sub substring_before
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $expect ) = @_;

   ref $expect or $expect = qr/\Q$expect/;

   my $endre = ( defined $self->{endofscope} ) ?
      qr/$expect|$self->{endofscope}/ :
      $expect;

   # NO skip_ws

   my $start = pos $self->{str};
   my $end;
   if( $self->{str} =~ m/\G(?s:.*?)($endre)/ ) {
      $end = $-[1];
   }
   else {
      $end = length $self->{str};
   }

   pos( $self->{str} ) = $end;
   return substr( $self->{str}, $start, $end - $start );
}

=head2 $val = $parser->generic_token( $name, $re, $convert )

Expects to find a token matching the precompiled regexp C<$re>. If provided,
the C<$convert> CODE reference can be used to convert the string into a more
convenient form. C<$name> is used in the failure message if the pattern fails
to match.

If provided, the C<$convert> function will be passed the parser and the
matching substring; the value it returns is returned from C<generic_token>.

 $convert->( $parser, $substr )

If not provided, the substring will be returned as it stands.

This method is mostly provided for subclasses to define their own token types.
For example:

 sub token_hex
 {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->generic_token( hex => qr/[0-9A-F]{2}h/, sub { hex $_[1] } );
 }

=cut

sub generic_token
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $name, $re, $convert ) = @_;

   $self->fail( "Expected $name" ) if $self->at_eos;

   $self->skip_ws;
   $self->{str} =~ m/\G$re/gc or
      $self->fail( "Expected $name" );

   my $match = substr( $self->{str}, $-[0], $+[0] - $-[0] );

   return $convert ? $convert->( $self, $match ) : $match;
}

sub _token_generic
{
   my $self = shift;
   my %args = @_;

   my $name    = $args{name};
   my $re      = $args{pattern} ? $self->{patterns}{ $args{pattern} } : $args{re};
   my $convert = $args{convert};

   $self->generic_token( $name, $re, $convert );
}

=head2 $int = $parser->token_int

Expects to find an integer in decimal, octal or hexadecimal notation, and
consumes it. Negative integers, preceeded by C<->, are also recognised.

=cut

sub token_int
{
   my $self = shift;
   $self->_token_generic(
      name => "int",

      pattern => "int",
      convert => sub {
         my $int = $_[1];
         my $sign = ( $int =~ s/^-// ) ? -1 : 1;

         $int =~ s/^0o/0/;

         return $sign * oct $int if $int =~ m/^0/;
         return $sign * $int;
      },
   );
}

=head2 $float = $parser->token_float

Expects to find a number expressed in floating-point notation; a sequence of
digits possibly prefixed by C<->, possibly containing a decimal point,
possibly followed by an exponent specified by C<e> followed by an integer. The
numerical value is then returned.

=cut

sub token_float
{
   my $self = shift;
   $self->_token_generic(
      name => "float",

      pattern => "float",
      convert => sub { $_[1] + 0 },
   );
}

=head2 $number = $parser->token_number

Expects to find a number expressed in either of the above forms.

=cut

sub token_number
{
   my $self = shift;
   $self->any_of( \&token_float, \&token_int );
}

=head2 $str = $parser->token_string

Expects to find a quoted string, and consumes it. The string should be quoted
using C<"> or C<'> quote marks.

The content of the quoted string can contain character escapes similar to
those accepted by C or Perl. Specifically, the following forms are recognised:

 \a               Bell ("alert")
 \b               Backspace
 \e               Escape

=head2 Accumulating Results Using Variables

Although the structure-forming methods all return a value, obtained from their
nested parsing code, it can sometimes be more convenient to use a variable to
accumulate a result in instead. For example, consider the following parser
method, designed to parse a set of C<name: "value"> assignments, such as might
be found in a configuration file, or YAML/JSON-style mapping value.

 sub parse_dict
 {
    my $self = shift;
 
    my %ret;
    $self->list_of( ",", sub {
       my $key = $self->token_ident;
       exists $ret{$key} and $self->fail( "Already have a mapping for '$key'" );
 
       $self->expect( ":" );
 
       $ret{$key} = $self->parse_value;
    } );
 
    return \%ret
 }

Instead of using the return value from C<list_of>, this method accumulates
values in the C<%ret> hash, eventually returning a reference to it as its
result. Because of this, it can perform some error checking while it parses;
namely, rejecting duplicate keys.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item *

Make unescaping of string constants more customisable. Possibly consider
instead a C<parse_string_generic> using a loop over C<substring_before>.

=item *

Easy ability for subclasses to define more token types as methods. Perhaps
provide a class method such as

 __PACKAGE__->has_token( hex => qr/[0-9A-F]+/i, sub { hex $_[1] } );

=item *

Investigate how well C<from_reader> can cope with buffer splitting across
other tokens than simply skippable whitespace
